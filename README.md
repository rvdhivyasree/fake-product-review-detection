#In the age of e-commerce, product reviews play a crucial role in shaping consumer decisions. However, the proliferation of fake reviews—fabricated to mislead consumers—poses significant challenges for both buyers and sellers. This abstract explores the concept of automated fake product review systems that can simulate fabricated reviews for testing fraud detection models. The proposed system employs advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to generate reviews indistinguishable from authentic ones, mimicking diverse writing styles, sentiments, and product categories. Such a tool aids in improving fraud detection mechanisms, enhancing their ability to identify deceptive content, and ensuring the credibility of online marketplaces. Key ethical considerations surrounding the use and misuse of this technology are also discussed, emphasizing the need for transparent and responsible application.
